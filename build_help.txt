This project has many javascript dependencies, these are all loaded in via NPM.

To load the dependences :
First you must have a working install of NPM and NODE

Run the following commands in the terminal

1) cd to the rapui python package dir
cd ../rapui/

2) Install all the NPM packages
npm install

# To Run web pack
webpack

# To make a prod build,
npm run build

# To run karma tests
rpm test

Thats it. PyCharm should monitor changes to the RapUI TypeScript files and webpack them.
All other project files, not in RapUI will be loaded on demand.

Or just run the DEV server
npm start
